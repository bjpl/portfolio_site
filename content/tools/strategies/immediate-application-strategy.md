## Core Principle
Use new language for real tasks within 24 hours of learning. Real necessity drives deeper encoding than abstract practice.

## Why It Works
Practical application creates necessity, which drives deeper encoding than abstract practice. Your brain prioritizes information it actually uses.

## The 24-Hour Rule

### Implementation Timeline
- **Hour 0**: Learn new concept
- **Hour 1-4**: Initial practice
- **Hour 4-12**: Plan real application
- **Hour 12-24**: Execute real task
- **Hour 24+**: Reflect and refine

## Implementation Framework

### The Task Generator
1. **Identify new learning**: What did I just learn?
2. **Find real need**: What do I actually need to do?
3. **Match them**: How can I use this learning?
4. **Set deadline**: When will I do this?
5. **Execute**: Do it, imperfectly is fine
6. **Document**: Record results

### The Necessity Creator
Sometimes you need to create necessity:
- Volunteer to explain in target language
- Commit to writing daily updates
- Promise to translate something
- Schedule conversation appointment
- Join online community
