## Core Principle
Fill the gaps between formal lessons with micro-practice. Transform waiting, commuting, and transition time into learning opportunities.

## Why It Works
Consistent micro-exposures maintain neural activation better than sporadic long sessions. Your brain stays primed for the target language, making formal study more effective.
