## Core Principle
Progressively refine language from basic communication to native-like precision. Start simple, add layers of sophistication systematically.

## Why It Works
Systematic refinement builds confidence while expanding expressive range. You maintain communication ability while developing elegance.

- Compound sentences
- Detailed descriptions
- Opinion expression

### Level 3: Nuanced Communication
- All tenses confidently
- 5000+ words
- Complex sentences
- Subtle distinctions
- Register awareness

### Level 4: Native-like Precision
- Idiomatic expressions
