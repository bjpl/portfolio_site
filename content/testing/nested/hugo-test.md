# Nested Content Structure Test

This tests creating content in nested directories to ensure Hugo compatibility.

## Hugo Features Tested

- Nested directory structure
- Front matter with Hugo-specific fields
- Weight for menu ordering
- Categories and tags
- ISO date format

## Directory Structure

```
testing/
└── nested/
    └── hugo-test.md
```

This should work seamlessly with Hugo's content organization.
