## ðŸ‘¥ Whole Persons, Real Histories

Learners and teachers must be understood as whole persons with histories, goals, and multiple identitiesâ€”not just language users. The relational view now addresses deterritorialized and unbounded digital contexts.

## Beyond the Language Learner Label

Traditional SLA research often reduces people to "learners" or "non-native speakers." The person-in-context view insists on recognizing:

- **Life histories** shaping current learning
- **Multiple identities** beyond student role
- **Future aspirations** driving present choices
- **Complex motivations** beyond instrumental goals

## Real Persons Create Real Learning

Authentic learning emerges when we acknowledge:

### Personal Backgrounds
- Family language histories
- Educational trajectories
- Professional experiences
- Cultural affiliations

### Positionality and Privilege
- Socioeconomic resources
- Racial and ethnic positioning
- Gender and sexuality
- Ability and access

### Power Dynamics
- Teacher-student hierarchies
- Native speaker ideologies
- Institutional constraints
- Peer relationships

## Digital Deterritorialization

Online spaces create new contextual complexities:

- **Unbounded interactions** across time zones
- **Multiple simultaneous contexts** in tabbed browsers
- **Collapsed contexts** where audiences merge
- **Algorithmic contexts** shaping exposure

## The Relational Turn

Person-in-context thinking emphasizes relationships:

### Teacher-Learner Relationships
Not transmission channels but co-constructive partnerships where both parties bring full selves to encounters.

### Peer Relationships
Not just practice partners but complex social networks with histories and futures beyond classroom walls.

### Community Relationships
Not abstract "target cultures" but specific communities with particular histories, power dynamics, and possibilities.

## Methodological Implications

Researching persons-in-context requires:

1. **Ethnographic sensibilities** attending to lived experience
2. **Narrative methods** capturing biographical complexity
3. **Participatory approaches** centering participant voices
4. **Longitudinal designs** tracking contextual shifts

## Pedagogical Applications

Teaching persons-in-context means:

- **Learning student names** and pronunciations
- **Acknowledging home languages** as resources
- **Connecting to real goals** beyond test scores
- **Addressing whole lives** not just study hours

## Institutional Challenges

Educational institutions often resist person-centered approaches through:

- Standardized curricula ignoring diversity
- Assessment regimes reducing complexity
- Time constraints preventing relationship building
- Administrative systems categorizing reductively

## Toward Humanizing Pedagogies

The person-in-context framework ultimately calls for humanizing pedagogies that see language education as human developmentâ€”not skill training but support for whole persons navigating complex worlds.
