## ðŸŽ­ Examining Teacher Positioning

Teachers must critically examine ideologies, identities, and positioning within classroom power structures. The framework now includes raciolinguistic ideologies and emotional-sensory dimensions.

## Unexamined Identity Perpetuates Inequality

Teacher identity isn't neutralâ€”it carries:

- **Linguistic ideologies** about "correct" language
- **Cultural assumptions** about learning styles
- **Racial positioning** affecting expectations
- **Class backgrounds** shaping perspectives

Without examination, these reproduce inequalities.

## Native Speaker Fallacy

The native speaker teacher myth persists despite evidence:

### Problems with Native-Speakerism
- Privileges accident of birth over expertise
- Ignores multilingual competencies
- Perpetuates racial hierarchies
- Devalues local teachers

### Alternative Frameworks
- Multilingual teacher as model
- Local teacher as cultural bridge
- Expert teacher regardless of L1
- Collaborative teaching teams

## Raciolinguistic Ideologies

Teachers must confront how race and language intersect:

### White Listening Subjects
Even "perfect" English from racialized speakers gets heard as deficient by white listeners expecting errors.

### Appropriateness Regimes
Standards of "appropriate" language encode white middle-class norms as universal.

### Linguistic Racism
Accent discrimination, dialect prejudice, and language policing maintain racial hierarchies.

## Emotional-Sensory Dimensions

Teaching involves embodied emotional labor:

### Emotional Work
- Managing classroom feelings
- Performing enthusiasm
- Hiding frustration
- Showing care

### Sensory Awareness
- Reading body language
- Sensing tension
- Noticing energy shifts
- Feeling classroom atmosphere

### Burnout and Care
- Sustaining emotional resources
- Setting boundaries
- Seeking support
- Practicing self-care

## Critical Self-Examination

Teachers need tools for identity work:

### Autobiographical Reflection
- Language learning histories
- Cultural positioning
- Privilege inventories
- Bias interruption

### Collaborative Inquiry
- Peer observations
- Critical friends groups
- Action research
- Study circles

### Student Feedback
- Anonymous evaluations
- Focus groups
- Exit interviews
- Ongoing dialogue

## Ideology in Practice

Teaching choices reveal ideologies:

### Curriculum Decisions
- Whose knowledge counts?
- Which varieties are taught?
- What cultures are centered?
- How is success defined?

### Classroom Interactions
- Who gets called on?
- Whose answers are elaborated?
- Which errors get corrected?
- How is participation valued?

### Assessment Practices
- What gets measured?
- How is progress defined?
- Who succeeds with these measures?
- What gets overlooked?

## Transformative Possibilities

Critical identity work enables:

### Pedagogical Innovation
- Translanguaging pedagogies
- Culturally sustaining practices
- Anti-racist approaches
- Decolonizing curricula

### Student Empowerment
- Validating home languages
- Challenging linguistic prejudice
- Supporting identity development
- Building critical consciousness

## Institutional Constraints

Teachers navigate institutional pressures:

- Standardized curricula limiting flexibility
- Testing regimes narrowing focus
- English-only policies
- Accountability measures

## Building Teacher Communities

Identity work requires support:

### Professional Learning Communities
- Regular meeting times
- Shared readings
- Classroom visits
- Collaborative planning

### Online Networks
- Twitter communities
- Facebook groups
- Discord servers
- Professional blogs

## The Political Teacher

All teaching is politicalâ€”the question is whether we acknowledge it:

- Maintaining status quo is political
- Challenging inequality is political
- Choosing materials is political
- Assessment decisions are political
