## üåê The Ecological Framework

Language acquisition occurs through complex interactions between learners, contexts, and communities‚Äînot through isolated cognitive processes. The ecological framework extends from individual affordances to planetary scales, addressing how learners navigate power in multilingual contexts.

## Core Principles

Learning is inseparable from the ecological systems in which it occurs. This requires:

- **Analysis of trajectories** across communities
- **Movement between** linguistic expectations  
- **Recognition of both** institutional structures and digital affordances

## Beyond Individual Processing

The ecological approach challenges traditional cognitivist models by positioning language learning as fundamentally interconnected with:

### Environmental Factors
- Physical spaces where learning occurs
- Digital and virtual environments
- Community contexts and cultural settings

### Social Networks
- Peer relationships and interactions
- Family and heritage language connections
- Professional and academic communities

### Power Dynamics
- Institutional hierarchies
- Linguistic hegemonies
- Access to resources and opportunities

## Implications for Practice

Understanding language learning ecologically means:

1. **Contextualizing all learning** within its specific environment
2. **Recognizing multiple scales** of influence from micro to macro
3. **Addressing power relations** explicitly in pedagogical choices
4. **Supporting learner agency** within structural constraints

## The Digital Ecology

Modern language learning increasingly occurs in digital spaces that create new ecological relationships:

- **Unbounded contexts** transcending physical location
- **Asynchronous interactions** across time zones
- **Multimodal affordances** combining text, audio, and video
- **Algorithmic mediation** shaping exposure and practice

## Moving Forward

The ecological perspective demands we see language learners not as isolated cognitive processors but as whole persons navigating complex systems of relationships, power, and possibility.
