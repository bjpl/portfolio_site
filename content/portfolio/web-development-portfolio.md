## Project Overview

Built a comprehensive e-commerce platform from scratch for TechStart Inc., serving over 10,000 active users. The platform features a modern, responsive design with real-time inventory management, secure payment processing through Stripe, and cloud deployment on AWS.

## Key Features

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface that works seamlessly across all devices
- **Real-time Search**: Elasticsearch-powered search with auto-suggestions and filters
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline functionality and installable app experience
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for 5 languages

### Technical Implementation
- **Microservices Architecture**: Scalable backend with separate services for auth, inventory, and payments
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live inventory and order status updates
- **Payment Security**: PCI-compliant payment processing with Stripe integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Sub-2 second load times with lazy loading and CDN distribution

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Handling High Traffic
The platform needed to handle Black Friday traffic spikes of 100x normal load.

**Solution**: Implemented auto-scaling on AWS with load balancers and Redis caching, resulting in 99.9% uptime during peak periods.

### Challenge: Complex Inventory Management
Managing inventory across multiple warehouses with real-time accuracy.

**Solution**: Built a distributed inventory system with event sourcing and CQRS pattern, ensuring consistency across all touchpoints.

## Results

- **Performance**: 85% improvement in page load times
- **Conversion**: 40% increase in conversion rate
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.8/5 average user rating
- **Revenue Impact**: $2M in additional revenue in first quarter

## Code Samples

```javascript
// Real-time inventory update system
class InventoryService {
  async updateStock(productId, quantity, operation) {
    const session = await mongoose.startSession();
    session.startTransaction();
    
    try {
      const product = await Product.findById(productId).session(session);
      
      if (operation === 'decrease' && product.stock < quantity) {
        throw new Error('Insufficient stock');
      }
      
      product.stock = operation === 'increase' 
        ? product.stock + quantity 
        : product.stock - quantity;
      
      await product.save({ session });
      await this.publishStockUpdate(productId, product.stock);
      await session.commitTransaction();
      
      return product;
    } catch (error) {
      await session.abortTransaction();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
