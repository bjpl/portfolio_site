# Again, with you

I would love to share California 
with you
It's blues, the new, and the skew.

to meet in Monterey
Bay of hues, the deep, another muse.

to San Francisco 
Circle the squares, ride in a robot, unscathed.

to stroll Redlands 
Citrus shaded, history dated, where I chopped down a tree.

I would love to show you the Salton Sea
It's really something to see, I would imagine
With you

Oh, to see it all again
with you.

I would love to share California 
with you.
