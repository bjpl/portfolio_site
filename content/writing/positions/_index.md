# SLA Theoretical Positions: An Ecological Approach

These positions represent current thinking in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theory, emphasizing ecological, social, and critical perspectives that challenge traditional cognitive and individualistic approaches.

## Core Theoretical Positions

### Foundational Frameworks
- **[Ecological Language Learning](ecological-language-learning/)** - Language acquisition through complex interactions
- **[Dialogic Acquisition](dialogic-acquisition/)** - Language emerges through social interaction
- **[Mediation](mediation/)** - Learning through social, psychological, and material tools

### Identity & Development
- **[Transformational Identity](transformational-identity/)** - Language learning transforms identity
- **[Person-in-Context](person-in-context/)** - Understanding learners as whole persons
- **[Emergent Motivation](emergent-motivation/)** - Motivation arising through interrelations

### Multilingual Perspectives
- **[Multi-Competence & Translanguaging](multi-competence-translanguaging/)** - Languages as interconnected resources
- **[Language Socialization](language-socialization/)** - Acquiring linguistic forms plus cultural knowledge
- **[Intercultural Communicative Competence](intercultural-communicative-competence/)** - Navigating diverse perspectives

### Social & Institutional
- **[Communities of Practice](communities-of-practice/)** - Movement from periphery to participation
- **[Collaborative Knowledge Construction](collaborative-knowledge-construction/)** - Knowledge through interaction
- **[Institutional Awareness](institutional-awareness/)** - How institutions shape learning

### Critical Perspectives
- **[Teacher Identity](teacher-identity/)** - Examining ideologies and positioning
- **[Complex Dynamic Development](complex-dynamic-development/)** - Non-linear trajectories

## Theoretical Evolution

These positions reflect major paradigm shifts:
- From **cognitive** to **social** orientations
- From **individual** to **ecological** perspectives  
- From **monolingual** to **multilingual** norms
- From **neutral** to **critical** stances
