Analysis at institutional levels reveals schools as non-neutral spaces.
The Hidden Curriculum Beyond explicit teaching, institutions teach through:
Spatial arrangements encoding hierarchies Temporal structures defining legitimate learning Assessment regimes determining value Linguistic policies privileging varieties Critical awareness demands analyzing these structures.
Institutional Power Structures Schools embody multiple power relations:
Administrative Hierarchies Who makes decisions?</description></item><item><title>Intercultural Communicative Competence</title><link>https://vocal-pony-24e3de.netlify.app/teaching-learning/sla-theory/intercultural-communicative-competence/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 10:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vocal-pony-24e3de.netlify.app/teaching-learning/sla-theory/intercultural-communicative-competence/</guid><description>üåè Beyond Linguistic Accuracy Language learning develops ability to navigate culturally diverse and socially complex perspectives. Evolution from competence to citizenship joins critical inter-ideological approaches and virtual reality applications.

Intercultural Competence Adding cultural awareness and sensitivity to linguistic skills.
Intercultural Citizenship Acting in the world to address injustice and promote understanding.</description></item><item><title>Teacher Identity</title><link>https://vocal-pony-24e3de.netlify.app/teaching-learning/sla-theory/teacher-identity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 10:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vocal-pony-24e3de.netlify.app/teaching-learning/sla-theory/teacher-identity/</guid><description>üé≠ Examining Teacher Positioning Teachers must critically examine ideologies, identities, and positioning within classroom power structures. The framework now includes raciolinguistic ideologies and emotional-sensory dimensions.
Unexamined Identity Perpetuates Inequality Teacher identity isn&amp;rsquo;t neutral‚Äîit carries:
Linguistic ideologies about &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; language Cultural assumptions about learning styles Racial positioning affecting expectations Class backgrounds shaping perspectives Without examination, these reproduce inequalities.
Native Speaker Fallacy The native speaker teacher myth persists despite evidence:
Problems with Native-Speakerism Privileges accident of birth over expertise Ignores multilingual competencies Perpetuates racial hierarchies Devalues local teachers Alternative Frameworks Multilingual teacher as model Local teacher as cultural bridge Expert teacher regardless of L1 Collaborative teaching teams Raciolinguistic Ideologies Teachers must confront how race and language intersect:</description></item></channel></rss>
