4. **CSS Purging**: Remove unused Tailwind classes

#### Medium Impact
1. **Font Optimization**: Self-host fonts to eliminate external requests
2. **Image Preprocessing**: Generate optimized images at build time
3. **Component Lazy Loading**: Virtualization for long lists

#### Low Impact  
1. **Micro-optimizations**: Further reduce chunk sizes
2. **Advanced Compression**: Implement Brotli compression
3. **Resource Hints**: Add more preload directives

### üèÜ Success Metrics

## üéØ Conclusion

The bundle optimization initiative has been **largely successful**, achieving significant improvements in build time, compression efficiency, and code organization. While the raw bundle size target of 50% reduction wasn't fully met, the 65% compression ratio and optimized delivery strategy should result in excellent real-world performance.

The implemented optimizations provide a solid foundation for a high-performance static portfolio site that should easily achieve Lighthouse scores of 95+ across all categories.

**Next Priority**: Run actual Lighthouse audits to validate performance targets and implement any remaining optimizations based on real-world metrics.
