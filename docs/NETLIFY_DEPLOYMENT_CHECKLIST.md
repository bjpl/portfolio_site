## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Build Issues

#### Hugo Build Failures
```bash
# Issue: Hugo version mismatch
# Solution: Update HUGO_VERSION in netlify.toml
HUGO_VERSION = "0.121.0"

# Issue: Missing themes or content
# Check: Ensure all submodules are updated
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Function Deployment Issues
```bash
# Issue: Function timeout
# Solution: Increase timeout in netlify.toml
[functions."function-name"]
  timeout = 30

# Issue: Missing dependencies
# Check: netlify/functions/package.json includes all required packages
```

### Runtime Issues

#### Authentication Problems
```bash
# Issue: Admin login fails
# Check: Environment variables in Netlify dashboard
- ADMIN_USERNAME set correctly
- ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH is valid bcrypt hash
- JWT_SECRET is properly configured

# Issue: Token verification fails
# Check: JWT_SECRET matches between functions
```

#### API Connectivity Issues
```bash
# Issue: Supabase connection fails
# Check: SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY is service_role key (not anon)
# Verify: Supabase project is not paused

# Issue: CORS errors
# Check: CORS_ORIGIN matches site URL
```

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Build Times
```bash
# Solution: Enable Hugo caching
HUGO_CACHEDIR = "/opt/build/cache/hugo"

# Solution: Use esbuild for functions
[functions]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
```

#### Slow Page Loads
```bash
# Check: Asset optimization enabled
# Verify: CDN caching working correctly
# Review: Image optimization settings
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Site Down
1. Check Netlify status page
2. Review recent deployments
3. Revert to last working deploy if needed
4. Check DNS settings
5. Verify SSL certificate status

### Security Incident
1. Immediately rotate all secrets
2. Check access logs for unusual activity
3. Update admin credentials
4. Review security headers
5. Consider temporary maintenance mode

### Data Breach
1. Secure all systems immediately
2. Rotate all API keys and secrets
3. Notify relevant parties
4. Document incident
5. Implement additional security measures
