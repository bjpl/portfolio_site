# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Backend Framework Selection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-08-23  
**Deciders**: System Architecture Team  

### Context
We need to select a backend framework for the portfolio site that supports rapid development, has good ecosystem support, and can scale to production requirements.

### Decision
We will use **Express.js** as our backend framework.

### Rationale
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Extensive middleware library and community support
- **Team Familiarity**: Development team has significant experience
- **Performance**: Adequate performance for our use case with optimization potential
- **Documentation**: Excellent documentation and learning resources
- **Flexibility**: Unopinionated framework allows architectural freedom

### Alternatives Considered
- **Fastify**: Better performance but smaller ecosystem and less team experience
- **Next.js API Routes**: Couples backend with frontend, limiting deployment flexibility  
- **Koa.js**: Modern but smaller community and fewer middleware options

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Fast development, extensive middleware, great community support
- **Negative**: Requires more setup compared to full-stack solutions, callback hell potential
- **Mitigation**: Use async/await patterns and modern JavaScript practices

## ADR-002: Database Selection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-08-23  
**Deciders**: System Architecture Team  

### Context
We need a database that supports complex queries, data integrity, JSON storage, and scales well for a content management system.

### Decision
We will use **PostgreSQL** as our primary database.

### Rationale
- **ACID Compliance**: Strong consistency and data integrity
- **JSON Support**: Native JSONB support for flexible schema requirements
- **Performance**: Excellent query performance with proper indexing
- **Scalability**: Supports read replicas and horizontal scaling
- **Open Source**: No licensing costs, active development community
- **Existing Investment**: Team has PostgreSQL experience

### Alternatives Considered
- **MongoDB**: Better for document storage but lacks ACID guarantees and team has less experience
- **MySQL**: Good performance but weaker JSON support and less advanced features
- **Firebase**: Managed solution but vendor lock-in and limited query capabilities

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Strong data integrity, complex queries, JSON flexibility, good performance
- **Negative**: Requires database management expertise, more complex than NoSQL for simple use cases
- **Mitigation**: Use managed PostgreSQL services in production, implement proper backup strategies

## ADR-003: Authentication Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-08-23  
**Deciders**: System Architecture Team  

### Context
We need an authentication system that supports multiple user types, integrates with third-party providers, and is secure and scalable.

### Decision
We will implement **JWT-based authentication with OAuth2 integration**.

### Rationale
- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required, easier to scale
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple authentication providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **Security**: Industry standard with good security practices
- **Frontend Friendly**: Easy to use with SPAs and mobile apps
- **Token Management**: Access tokens (15min) + Refresh tokens (7 days) for security

### Alternatives Considered
- **Session-based**: Requires server-side storage, harder to scale
- **Auth0**: Third-party service reduces development time but adds dependency and cost
- **Passport.js only**: Good for OAuth but requires additional JWT implementation

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Scalable, flexible, secure, good developer experience
- **Negative**: Token management complexity, potential security issues if misconfigured
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper token rotation, secure storage practices, comprehensive security testing

## ADR-004: Caching Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-08-23  
**Deciders**: System Architecture Team  

### Context
We need a caching solution to improve API response times, reduce database load, and support session storage for authentication.

### Decision
We will use **Redis** as our primary caching solution.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: In-memory storage provides excellent performance
- **Data Structures**: Rich data types beyond simple key-value pairs
- **Persistence**: Optional persistence for critical cached data
- **Pub/Sub**: Support for real-time features if needed
- **Session Storage**: Ideal for JWT refresh token storage
- **Ecosystem**: Good Node.js integration and monitoring tools

### Alternatives Considered
- **Memcached**: Simpler but lacks data structures and persistence
- **In-memory caching**: No network overhead but limited scalability
- **Database query caching**: PostgreSQL built-in but less flexible

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Significant performance improvement, flexible data storage, scalability
- **Negative**: Additional infrastructure component, memory usage, potential data loss
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper cache invalidation, use Redis persistence features, monitor memory usage
