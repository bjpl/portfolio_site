#### Rationale
**For SQLite**:
- Zero-configuration deployment
- ACID compliance for metadata integrity
- Excellent performance for read-heavy workloads
- Simple backup and replication
- Perfect for single-server deployments

**For File System**:
- Hugo native compatibility
- Version control friendly (Git)
- Direct file editing capability
- No vendor lock-in
- Transparent backup with Git

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Deployment simplicity (no external database required)
- Git-based version control for content
- Fast metadata queries with SQLite
- Hugo compatibility maintained

**Negative**:
- More complex data consistency management
- Limited scaling options compared to dedicated database
