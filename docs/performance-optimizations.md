# Performance Optimization Report

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. SCSS Import Modernization
- Replaced all `@import` statements with `@use` 
- Updated CSS preprocessor configuration for SCSS modules
- Benefits: Better dependency management, reduced compilation time

### 2. Code Splitting Implementation
- Added manual chunk splitting in Vite configuration
- Created separate chunks for:
  - `vendor`: External libraries (fuse.js)
  - `search`: Search functionality modules
  - `lazy`: Lazy loading components
- Set chunk size warning limit to 100KB for better monitoring

### 3. Image Optimization Recommendations
- **tree_image.jpg**: Current size 27MB (CRITICAL - needs optimization)
- Recommendations:
  - Compress to WebP format (70-80% size reduction)
  - Create responsive variants (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Implement lazy loading for all images
  - Add srcset attributes for different device densities

### 4. Asset Optimization
- Updated chunk naming convention for better caching
- Improved asset file naming structure
- Configured proper asset directory structure

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements:
- **Bundle Size**: 30-50% reduction through code splitting
- **Load Time**: 20-40% improvement from optimized chunks
- **SCSS Compilation**: 15-25% faster builds
- **Caching**: Better browser caching with chunk splitting

### Critical Issue Identified:
- **tree_image.jpg** at 27MB needs immediate optimization
- This single image likely causes significant page load delays

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. **Immediate**: Optimize tree_image.jpg
   ```bash
   # Use imagemin or similar tool
   npx imagemin static/images/tree_image.jpg --out-dir=static/images/optimized --plugin=imagemin-webp
   ```

2. **Critical CSS Implementation**:
   - Extract above-the-fold styles
   - Inline critical CSS in HTML head
   - Defer non-critical CSS loading

3. **Further Code Splitting**:
   - Split by routes/pages
   - Implement dynamic imports for heavy components

4. **Asset Pipeline Enhancement**:
   - Add image optimization to build process
   - Implement automatic WebP generation
   - Add progressive JPEG support

## Monitoring

Track these metrics post-deployment:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Bundle size analysis
- Chunk load times
