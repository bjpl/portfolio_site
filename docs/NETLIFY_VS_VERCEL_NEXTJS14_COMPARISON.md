### Alternative: Hybrid Approach

If migration seems too complex:

1. **Keep Hugo site on Netlify** (current portfolio)
2. **Deploy Next.js admin panel on Vercel** (new features)
3. **Use subdomain routing** (admin.yoursite.com → Vercel)

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Benefits of Migration
- **Performance**: 40-50% improvement in build and runtime performance
- **Reliability**: Native Next.js support reduces deployment issues
- **Scalability**: Better auto-scaling for dynamic content
- **Developer Productivity**: Faster development cycles

### Costs of Migration
- **Time Investment**: 2-4 weeks of development time
- **Learning Curve**: Team familiarity with new platform
- **Feature Re-implementation**: Forms, identity management
- **Risk**: Potential short-term disruptions

## Conclusion

For your Next.js 14 portfolio site with modern features like App Router and Server Components, **Vercel is the clear technical choice**. The performance benefits, native Next.js integration, and future-proofing outweigh the migration effort.

However, if you prefer to minimize risk and maintain your current well-optimized Netlify setup, consider a **hybrid approach** where you keep the Hugo site on Netlify and deploy new Next.js features on Vercel via subdomain routing.

The decision ultimately depends on your priorities:
- **Choose Vercel** if performance and Next.js optimization are critical
- **Stay with Netlify** if minimizing migration effort is the priority
- **Use hybrid approach** if you want the best of both worlds
