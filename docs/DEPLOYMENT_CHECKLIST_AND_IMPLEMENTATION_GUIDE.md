- [x] All required files generated
- [x] No localhost references in build
- [x] Assets properly minified
- [x] Images optimized (WebP/AVIF)
- [x] Critical CSS extracted

#### Performance Targets
| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Performance Score | >80 | TBD | 🔄 |
| Accessibility Score | >90 | TBD | 🔄 |
| Load Time | <2s | TBD | 🔄 |
| First Contentful Paint | <2s | TBD | 🔄 |
| Largest Contentful Paint | <2.5s | TBD | 🔄 |

```bash
# Run performance baseline
node scripts/performance-monitor.js once
```

## 🚀 Phase 4: Deployment Execution

### ✅ Pre-Deployment Steps

1. **Code Quality Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run comprehensive test suite
   npm run test:ci
   
   # Security audit
   npm audit --audit-level high
   
   # Lint and format
   npm run lint
   npm run format:check
   ```

2. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Run Supabase migrations
   npx supabase db push
   
   # Verify schema
   npx supabase db diff
   ```

3. **Function Deployment Test**
   ```bash
   # Test Netlify functions locally
   netlify dev
   
   # Test specific endpoints
   curl http://localhost:8888/api/health
   curl http://localhost:8888/api/auth/me
   ```

### ✅ Deployment Process

#### Netlify Deployment
```bash
# Deploy via CLI
netlify deploy --prod --dir=public

# Or via GitHub Actions (automatic)
git push origin main
```

#### Deployment Verification
```bash
# Health check
curl -f https://vocal-pony-24e3de.netlify.app/api/health

# Admin panel access
curl -I https://vocal-pony-24e3de.netlify.app/admin

# API endpoints
curl -f https://vocal-pony-24e3de.netlify.app/sitemap.xml
```

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_id":"your-id","client_secret":"your-secret","audience":"your-audience","grant_type":"client_credentials"}'

# Check function logs
netlify functions:log auth-login
```

**Issue: Performance degradation**
```bash
# Run performance analysis
node scripts/performance-monitor.js once

# Check resource usage
npm run test:performance
```
